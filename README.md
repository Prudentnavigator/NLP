●Create a new Python file called garden.py.
●Find at least 5 garden path sentences from the web or think up your own.
●Store the sentences you have identified or created in a list called garden path Sentences.
●Tokenise each sentence in the list and perform entity recognition.
●Examine how spaCy has categorised each sentence. Then, use spacy.explain to look up and print the meaning of entities that you don’t understand. For example: print(spacy.explain("FAC"))
●At the bottom of your file, write a comment about two entities that you looked up. For each entity answer the following questions:
○What was the entity and its explanation that you looked up?
○Did the entity make sense in terms of the word associated with it?
